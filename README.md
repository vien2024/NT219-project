## Overview
- Scenario:
The company is implementing a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service and employing RSA encryption in the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol to ensure the security of transmitted data. Evaluating the security of such a system is crucial to ensure the protection of user data.
- Gaps:
RSA, while offering good security with shorter key lengths compared to traditional methods, can be vulnerable if not implemented correctly or if small primes are chosen.
- Motivations:
 To ensure secure communication between VPN client and VPN server to maintain user trust and data integrity.
